Advent of Code 2019 code snippets

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019) is an online coding challenge advent calendar. I'm competing with several friends to complete as many of the tasks as possible. You get more points for completing them quickly, but we all agree that it's more impressive just to finish them.

Some of this code really sucks, but I'm actually proud of other pieces of it. Of course, none of the files will have comments or much documentation at all, but feel free to ask me how they work!
